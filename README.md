# Diabetes Prediction and Classification
- A machine learning webapp created using Streamlit to predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures
- Dataset used over here is obtained from Kaggle, Pima Indians Diabetes Database
  - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database
- Used Random Forest Classifier to train the model, with multiple algorithms compared in the jupyter notebook
- Achieved an accuracy score of 0.89 and an AUC score of 0.93 

## Installation
