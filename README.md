# Diabetes Prediction and Classification
- A machine learning webapp created using Streamlit to predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures
- Dataset used over here is obtained from Kaggle, Pima Indians Diabetes Database
  - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database
- Used Random Forest Classifier to train the model, with multiple algorithms compared in the jupyter notebook
- Achieved an accuracy score of 0.89 and an AUC score of 0.93 

## Installation
Install all streamlit requirements by run the following command

> pip install requirements.txt

## Run Streamlit

To access and use the application,donwoload or clone the repository and then run the command below.
> streamlit run app.py

## Streamlit Cloud

The application has been deployed in the Streamlit Cloud.You can access here: [https://devpatel18-diabetes-prediction-streamlit-app-xfg7d9.streamlit.app/](https://devpatel18-diabetes-prediction-streamlit-app-xfg7d9.streamlit.app/)

NOTE : The app might go to sleep due to inactive traffic, wake up the app in that case
